            </p>

            <p className="bold">
            1. eCommerce SEO

             <p className="bold">
             2. Remarketing Ads / Retargeting Ads:
            </p>

            <p>
            Since Google introduced its remarketing platform, eCommerce businesses have taken advantage of it to the fullest and increased their conversion rates by 300-400%+. So what’s an online retailer to do if people visit your site searching for something specific and discover it but don’t purchase it? The best option is to offer dynamic retargeted advertisements. From Facebook to Google, the technology allows marketers to follow customers wherever they travel. 
            </p>

            <p>
            By displaying ads that feature images of the same item, your business is at the forefront of their minds and provides an easy link to your website. Retargeting ads work great on social media; however, they might only suit some. Like all paid campaigns, it is essential to experiment before committing to spending a lot of money on ads.
            </p>

            <p className="bold">
            3. Video Marketing
            </p>

            <p>
            Videos have a significant impact on your business. Videos improve brand recognition by 139 percent and boost conversion rates by 86 percent. Creating videos about your product, details relevant to your industry, or even a behind-the-scenes view of your company is possible. Using video to showcase products, product information videos, and tell stories will continue to be an effective way to engage with customers and drive sales.
            </p>

            <p className="bold">
            4. AR/VR and AI in eCommerce Digital Marketing
            </p>

            <p>
            AI (artificial intelligence), AR (augmented reality), and VR (virtual reality) are all technologies that are increasingly being used in eCommerce digital marketing to enhance the customer experience and drive sales.
            </p>

            <p>
            AI can be used to personalize the shopping experience for customers, for example, by recommending products based on their browsing and purchase history and also by providing personalized product search results. AI can also be used to improve customer service through chatbots that can answer customer questions and provide assistance in real time.
            </p>

            <p>
            AR can be used to enhance the product visualization experience, for example, by allowing customers to see how a piece of furniture would look in their own home or how a piece of jewelry would look on them before making a purchase. AR can also be used to create virtual try-on experiences for clothing and makeup.
            </p>

            
            <p>
            VR can be used to create immersive shopping experiences, for example, by allowing customers to “walk” through a virtual store or showroom or by creating virtual product demonstrations. VR can also be used to create virtual events such as product launches or fashion shows.
            </p>

            <p className="bold" >
            5. Mobile Optimization
            </p>

            <p>
            Another thing in our eCommerce digital marketing trends collection is optimizing your mobile user. More and more people are shopping on mobile devices online — more than 40 percent of transactions are done on mobile devices. So if you’re hoping to generate more revenue for your eCommerce site, you need to start optimizing your website for mobile.
            </p>

            <p>
            To ensure a mobile-friendly experience, you should begin by making responsive design an integral part of your eCommerce website. The resilient design will ensure that your website can adapt to any device your user uses. Likewise, your site will adapt to the screen of the user.
            </p>

            <p>
            Furthermore, your site can include mobile-friendly elements, such as thumb-friendly buttons or hamburger menus. If you provide a pleasant smartphone experience, you’ll keep customers interested in your company and interested in your offerings.
            </p>

            <p className='bold'>
            6. Virtual Payment Options
            </p>

            <p>
            The cryptocurrency market saw a massive increase in popularity during the past year. We anticipate that trend to last, but only after we have overcome some obstacles.
            </p>

            <p>
            The currencies (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) do not yet have the name recognition required to be widely adopted. However, they’ll become more popular when people understand how they function. Although cryptocurrencies aren’t suitable for every company however, those who choose to use their use could gain an advantage over competitors thanks to lower fees and quicker processing times for payments.   
            </p>
            
            
            <p>
            Mobile payment is a different field that has seen massive growth. As per Statista, the global number of iPhone users who activated Apple Pay grew by more than 65 million by 2020, with the number of people using Android Pay also rising. Mobile payments are now responsible for a third of all digital transactions and are likely to increase as other methods like Bitcoin continue to gain popularity.   
            </p>

            <p className='bold'>
            7. Personalized Marketing 
            </p>

            <p>
            Specific trends within eCommerce internet marketing will be relevant in the coming years, as personalization isn’t one of them. Numerous businesses compete for attention from your target audience to convince them to purchase your products. Unfortunately, the average consumer needs more time to spend on promotions such as offers, promotions, or advertisements that aren’t relevant to them. Through personalization, you can give your customers the information they need and provide a unique experience to your target audience.
            </p>


            <p>
            One of the best channels to personalize your email is. When users sign up to the email lists you have, you want to personalize the experience by offering content that is specific to their needs. For instance, when you run a boutique selling clothing and have a client keen on their shoes, you could send personalized emails regarding new footwear items.
            </p>

            <p>
            It is also possible to personalize your emails by adding the subscriber’s name to your email. Again, this is a minor addition that’s not a big deal, but it’s a fantastic method to let your readers know that your email content is tailored for your subscribers.
            </p>

            <p className='bold'>
            8. Shoppable Live Streams
            </p>

            <p>
            Many users prefer to interact with their products using videos instead of pictures. Therefore, in 2023, there will be more emphasis on creating videos that customize your experience when interacting with your services or products.
            </p>

            <p>
            Do you remember the old-fashioned home channels for shopping? The channels have made an appearance, specifically through streaming channels. Think of YouTube, Facebook Live, Instagram Live, and TikTok. The idea is identical – except that the presenter has a role as an influencer. The video is not edited, and the audience can interact with the host live. It was popular during the epidemic because it gave customers a more secure shopping method, but it’s showing no signs of letting up anytime soon.
            </p>

             <p className='bold'>
              Conclusion
             </p>
             <p>
             Suppose you’re interested in learning more about ways to increase conversions using new trends in eCommerce internet marketing.

              </p>
             <p>
